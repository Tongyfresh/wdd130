            After a fulfilling seven-year career in the fast-paced world of
            mortgage capital markets, I've embarked on a new professional
            and educational adventure, pivoting to my passion in tech. This
            transition has been an exciting journey of growth and learning.
            On a personal note, though I've been looking for work for a
            little while now, my life is wonderfully busy with my
            two-year-old daughter, who keeps me on my toes, and I'm looking
            forward to celebrating my sixth wedding anniversary with my wife
            this year. It's a life full of exciting changes, both
            professionally and personally, and I wouldn't have it any other
            way.
